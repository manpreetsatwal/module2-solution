			Sushi
		</div>
		<p>
			Sushi is a very healthy meal! It's a good source of heart healthy omega-3 fatty acids thanks to the fish it's made with. Sushi is also low in calories – there's no added fat. The most common type is nigiri sushi – fingers of sticky rice topped with a small filet of fish or seafood.
